12/03/2024

    Initial project creation.
    Split app out into separate page routes
    Added a Navbar and styling

14/03/2024

    Attempted to implement a video player to have short .mp4 files, but could only find old library documentation. Have settled for imaged that will rotate automatically.
    Added object containing all project data and added a useEffect to call pull that data in. I've kept the project data in a separate file so that it's easy to update in the future, instead of digging through the app itself.
    Created project sliders

15/03/2025

    Restructured the project data file to be TypeScript friendly - took a bit but has been a valuable learning experience in how explicit you have to be with TS.
